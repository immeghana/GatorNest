- Payment tracking and history – The database setup is done, but we need further discussions on UI and additional payment options.
- Maintenance request tracking – The database schema is in place, but API implementation is still pending.
- Unit testing for APIs – The testing framework setup faced delays due to some environment issues.

We made solid progress in Sprint 1, covering the essential authentication and database structure. The next step is to finalize the integration of room booking, maintenance request tracking, and payment history while refining the UI.

### Plans for Sprint 2
- Complete room booking integration.
